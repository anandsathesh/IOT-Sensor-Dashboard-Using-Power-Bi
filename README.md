# 📊 IoT Sensor Dashboard using Power BI

This project demonstrates how to visualize sensor data (Temperature, Humidity, and Gas levels) from an IoT system using **Power BI**. It is designed for beginners who want to learn data visualization by working with real-world-style datasets.


## 📁 Dataset

The sample dataset `iot_data_sample.csv` includes 20 rows of simulated data recorded at 5-minute intervals. The fields include:

- `Time` — Timestamp of reading
- `Temperature` — Readings from DHT11 (°C)
- `Humidity` — Readings from DHT11 (%)
- `Gas` — Readings from MQ2 sensor (arbitrary units)


## 🎯 Dashboard Features

- 📈 **Line Chart** showing trends of temperature, humidity, and gas over time
- 🃏 **Card Visuals** displaying:
  - Average Humidity
  - Average Gas
  - Max Temperature
- 🎨 Styled layout with custom titles, fonts, and alignment


## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop** (Free)
- Sample data in CSV format (You can use data from ESP8266, Raspberry Pi, or other IoT devices)


## 🧠 Learnings

- Basic Power BI layout and design
- Aggregating and visualizing sensor data
- Creating clean dashboards for IoT analytics


## 🧩 Future Ideas

- 🔄 Connect to live IoT data using ThingSpeak, Google Sheets, or APIs
- 📤 Publish dashboard to Power BI Service for online viewing
- 🧠 Integrate with machine learning insights for anomaly detection
